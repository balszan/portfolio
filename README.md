 Portfolio Website

A responsive portfolio website showcasing my projects and skills as a full stack developer. It features sections for about me, projects, and contact information.

**Live demo:** https://balszan.dev/

### How It's Made

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

The website is built using semantic HTML structure for improved organization and readability. CSS flexbox is employed for efficient layouts, with media queries ensuring responsiveness across different devices. JavaScript adds interactivity for elements like the hamburger menu on smaller screens.
